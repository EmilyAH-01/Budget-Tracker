INSTALLATION:
Download all files, then enter "npm install" in command line. Node.js and MongoDB are required.

USAGE:
Start MongoDB locally. Then, in command line, enter: npm start

DESCRIPTION: 
This Progressive Web Application (PWA) uses Express, Node.js, and MongoDB to save and plot financial transactions input by a user. IndexedDB is used to locally save transactions that are input offline; when the app is brought back online, these transactions are posted to the database.

The manifest.webmanifest and service-worker.js files allow for a shortcut link to be downloaded to the user's desktop or phone screen; this link allows the application to be opened and operated outside the browser. To download the link, open the deployed application link in Google Chrome, click the menu button in the upper right corner, then click "Install Budget Tracker".
